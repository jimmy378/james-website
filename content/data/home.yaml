- title: Motion Graphics
  body: I love making things move, from the simplest typography to complex characters.
    I believe all design can be elevated with a touch of motion (or more then a touch).
    This passion stretches across screen media and interactive design.
- title: Web Development
  body: I enjoy executing interactive designs, including web sites, applications and
    games. I work mostly in React and regular HTML, CSS and Javascript. One of my
    primary focuses in web development is implementing motion in an interactive way.
- title: Design
  body: Design underpins all my work, whether it is motion or development. I enjoy
    the challenge of simplifying an idea into it's most potent form with a strong
    emphasis on functionality.
